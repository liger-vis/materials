General Experience: ""So I definitely like. I definitely definitely like the filtering by demonstration. being able to highlight parts and drag them out was I thin very intuitive. Say if it was the touch screen that was exactly what I would have done. It was natural for me to do filtering by demonstration. As I said in the previous question it was just expecting when I am selecting a set of points the system keep them rather than excluding. ""     ""But, in some of them for some reason I felt that. so when I wanted to apply say color and color was something which was because I think it was when I wanted to assign color to directors, doing the interaction by demonstration I did not get a recommendation that I wanted for that. So I then said lets do it using another interaction technique. For filtering I definitely felt it feels more natural to do it this way [by demonstration]. Overall, I would prefer doing things by demonstration if it makes sense to do it in the same way in the real word. Now that I think even coloring [by demonstration] is somewhat natural. say I want to highlight something, I pick them and color them, but it [coloring by demonstration] depends on how much data we are dealing. With a small dataset I would probbaly prefer doing the coloring by demonstration but with the larger dataset, I would probably would say no lets do drag and drop. Dragging variables and dropping them here [Encoding Panel] was very consistent. You do drag and drop to change color, size, axes."" Both interaction: `` I used two techniques for filtering. Because the demonstration filtering is intuitive but not very precise.

So generally in tools what happens is that you stuck with some drop-down menus, radio buttons or check boxes to filter but this is actually letting me to interact with the data which is really good. I also sometime used demonstration for assigning colors. For example, here the points on top right corner seems interesting to me because they have a high imdb rating. I love this feature [coloring by demo] because it allows me to color them directly instead of me thinking which attribute should I assign to color so that these points have the same color. This [coloring by demo] also allows me to visually separate out points which I am interested then the system take attributes that are similar between those points and suggest me attributes which is really good. I really prefer using this method [VbD] rather than choosing a predefine color categories [MVS]. That is th beatuy or advantage of this system""  Both Ineteraction: `` Yes definitely. Presenting the users with more options I know sometime might get overwhelming, but genrally people get familiar with the system after trying it a couple of times. At least that was the case for me.

I first selected the points based on the visual interest and colored them using demonstration. I then dragthem them to the filter panel [Demonstration].
